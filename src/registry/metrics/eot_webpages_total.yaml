    # Improved selector: Look for the link with `alive:true` facet URL (Internet Archive usually has these).
    # OR: Just try to get the text "Live (X)" via text match?
    # Cheerio :contains is good.
    # Let's try slightly looser selector.
    # .facets-header that contains text "Live Web Status" -> next UL -> find LI that contains text "Live" -> find .count
